# User Suspension System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the user suspension system with reason tracking and appropriate messaging.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Suspension System

#### User Model Updates (`backend/models/user.py`)
- Added suspension tracking fields:
  - `suspension_reason`: Stores the reason for suspension
  - `suspended_by`: Stores who suspended the user
  - `suspended_at`: Stores when the user was suspended

#### Enhanced Methods:
- `deactivate_user(reason=None, suspended_by=None)`: Deactivates user with optional reason
- `activate_user()`: Reactivates user and clears suspension data
- `to_dict()`: Includes suspension information in user data

#### Admin Routes Updates (`backend/routes/admin_routes.py`)
- Modified `/users/<user_id>/toggle-status` endpoint to:
  - Accept suspension reason in request body
  - Track who suspended the user
  - Protect developer accounts from suspension

#### Authentication Updates (`backend/routes/auth_routes.py`)
- Enhanced login endpoint to return appropriate suspension messages:
  - With reason: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: {Reason}"
  - Without reason: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: Contact admin"
  - Developer suspension: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: Contact Developer"

### 2. Frontend Suspension System

#### Suspension Modal Component (`frontend/src/components/common/SuspensionModal.jsx`)
- Professional modal for displaying suspension messages
- Shows suspension reason if provided
- Shows who suspended the user
- Clean, user-friendly interface

#### AuthContext Updates (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
- Added suspension modal state management
- Enhanced login function to handle suspension responses
- Automatic display of suspension modal when login fails due to suspension

#### User Management Updates (`frontend/src/pages/admin/Users.jsx`)
- Added suspension modal for deactivating users
- Optional reason input field
- Enhanced toggle status functionality
- Developer account protection (buttons disabled with tooltips)

#### Login Page Updates (`frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`)
- Enhanced to handle suspension responses
- Clears form when suspension modal is shown

## Message Flow

### When Suspending a User:

1. **Admin/Developer/Super Admin** clicks "Deactivate" on a user
2. **Suspension Modal** appears asking for optional reason
3. **Backend** stores:
   - `is_active: false`
   - `suspension_reason: "reason if provided"`
   - `suspended_by: "Admin Name (role)"`
   - `suspended_at: "timestamp"`

### When Suspended User Tries to Login:

1. **User** attempts login with credentials
2. **Backend** checks if account is active
3. **If suspended**, returns appropriate message:
   - **With reason**: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: {Reason}"
   - **Without reason**: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: Contact admin"
   - **Suspended by developer**: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: Contact Developer"
4. **Frontend** displays suspension modal with message
5. **User** sees professional suspension notification

## Developer Account Protection

### Backend Protection:
- Developer accounts cannot be deactivated, deleted, or modified
- API endpoints return 403 error for developer modification attempts

### Frontend Protection:
- Developer role appears in black text on gray background
- Action buttons (edit, reset password, toggle status, delete) are disabled
- Tooltips explain why actions are disabled
- Toast error messages if modification is attempted

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Suspension with Reason:**
   - Login as admin/super admin
   - Go to Users page
   - Click "Deactivate" on a user
   - Enter reason: "Violation of community guidelines"
   - Confirm suspension
   - Try to login as suspended user
   - Should see: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: Violation of community guidelines"

4. **Test Suspension without Reason:**
   - Reactivate the user
   - Deactivate again without entering reason
   - Try to login as suspended user
   - Should see: "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: Contact admin"

5. **Test Developer Protection:**
   - Try to deactivate a developer account
   - Should see error: "Developer accounts cannot be deactivated"
   - Buttons should be disabled with tooltips

6. **Test Reactivation:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to Users page
   - Click "Activate" on suspended user
   - User should be able to login normally

### Automated Testing:
Run the test script (when database is properly configured):
```bash
cd backend
python test_suspension.py
```

## API Endpoints

### Suspend User
```
POST /api/admin/users/{user_id}/toggle-status
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body: { "reason": "Optional suspension reason" }
```

### Login (Suspended User)
```
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { "identifier": "email/username", "password": "password" }
Response (401): {
  "message": "Your Account is Suspended/Deactivated: {reason}",
  "suspended": true,
  "suspension_reason": "reason",
  "suspended_by": "Admin Name (role)"
}
```

## Database Schema Updates

The users collection now includes these additional fields:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  "suspension_reason": "string or null",
  "suspended_by": "string or null", 
  "suspended_at": "datetime or null"
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Developer Protection**: Developer accounts are completely protected from modification
2. **Audit Trail**: All suspensions are tracked with who, when, and why
3. **Role-based Access**: Only admins, super admins, and developers can suspend users
4. **Input Validation**: Suspension reasons are properly sanitized
5. **Session Management**: Suspended users cannot access any protected routes

## UI/UX Features

1. **Professional Suspension Modal**: Clean, informative suspension notification
2. **Visual Developer Distinction**: Developer role appears in black text
3. **Disabled Actions**: Clear visual indication of protected accounts
4. **Helpful Tooltips**: Explain why actions are disabled
5. **Toast Notifications**: Provide immediate feedback for actions
6. **Form Clearing**: Login form clears when suspension modal appears

## Error Handling

1. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work even if suspension data is missing
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Users understand exactly why they can't login
3. **Fallback Messages**: Default messages when specific data is not available
4. **Logging**: All suspension actions are logged for audit purposes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Suspension Duration**: Add temporary suspensions with automatic reactivation
2. **Appeal System**: Allow users to appeal suspensions
3. **Bulk Operations**: Suspend multiple users at once
4. **Suspension History**: Track all suspension/activation events
5. **Email Notifications**: Send suspension notifications via email
6. **Suspension Levels**: Different levels of suspension (warning, temporary, permanent)

## Conclusion

The suspension system is now fully implemented with:
- ✅ Backend suspension tracking with reasons
- ✅ Frontend suspension modal display
- ✅ Developer account protection
- ✅ Professional user experience
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Security and audit features

The system provides a complete solution for user account management with proper suspension handling and developer protection as requested.
